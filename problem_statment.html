        <h2>KPl's Requirement</h2>
        <p class="color"> The HR department is responsible for monitoring and managing various aspects of emplyoee data to  ensure the
             organization maintains a healthy workforce. However, there is a lack of clear performance indicators to track and analyze 
             key HR metrics. Therefore, there is a need design and implement a set of KPL's to address the following points:</p>

        <h3>1. Employee Count :</h3>
        <p> The HR department lacks visibility into the total number of emplyoees, making it challenging to assess workforce size 
            and plan for future growth or downsizing effectively.
        </p>   

        <h3>2. Attrition Count : </h3>
        <p>The organization lacks a standardized method to track emplyoee attrition, resulting in incomplete and unreliable data on 
            the number of emplyoee who have left the organization.
        </p>
        
        <h3>3. Attrition Rate : </h3>
        <p> Without a clear measure of attrition rate, the organization cannot assess the overall turnover level or compare it with 
            industry benchmarks, hindering the ability to gauge emplyoee satisfaction and engagement.
        </p>
        
        <h3>4. Active Employee : </h3>
        <p>THe organization lacks a mechanism to differentiate between active and inactive emplyoee, leading to difficulties in 
            accurately assessing the current workforce's productivity and capacity.
        </p>  

        <h3>5. Average Age : </h3>
        <p> The HR department lacks visibility into the average age of emplyoees. making it difficult to evaluate workforce 
            demographics, succession planning, and the organization's ability to attract and retain younger taient.
